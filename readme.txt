Narrated Adventurs Support 1.0
------------------------------

I thought it is about time to do a more enjoyable game as the guessing game some projects ago. So I thought about an adventure game.

However this is such a big project that it has to be split up into several projects combined together at the end because of the limited code space of 100 bytes at the moment.

Note: This project does not run on its own. It is needed as a part of the upcoming adventure game.
